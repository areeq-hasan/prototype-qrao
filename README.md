### About This Project

The Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) module is designed to enable users to leverage a new quantum method for combinatorial optimization problems. This approach incorporates Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) as a tool to encode multiple classical binary variables into a single qubit, thereby saving quantum resources and enabling exploration of larger problem instances on a quantum computer. The encodings produce a local quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state can be approximated with standard algorithms such as VQE and QAOA, and then rounded to yield approximation solutions of the original problem.

The figure at the top of this page illustrates a simple example of encoding a degree-3 graph with 10 vertices into just 4 qubits, instead of 10. The graph is colored (with a largest-degree-first greedy algorithm) such that adjacent vertices are of a different color. Then, vertices of a given color are encoded using a (3,1,p) QRAC so that a maximum of 3 vertices are associated with a single qubit. Check out the [background documentation](https://github.com/qiskit-community/prototype-qrao/blob/main/docs/background/quantum_relaxations.ipynb) to learn more about the coloring algorithm, QRACs, and building associated local quantum Hamiltonians.

This project evolved out of research at IBM Quantum on [Approximate Solutions of Combinatorial Problems via Quantum Relaxations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03167)

***Problem Statement***

Given a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem represented by a relaxation to a local quantum Hamiltonian, find an approximate solution by rounding the energy associated with a candidate ground state. This Hamiltonian is constructed using quantum random access codes for memory compression, which allows each qubit to encode more than one binary variable.

***QRAO Flowchart***

Quantum random access optimization is composed of two main steps as shown in the flowchart below.

1. The input problem is encoded into a quantum Hamiltonian using the `QuantumRandomAccessEncoding` class. The maximum number of original classical binary variables encoded into each qubit is specified by `max_vars_per_qubit`.
2. The encoded problem is solved with the `QuantumRandomAccessOptimizer`, which uses a minimum eigensolver on the quantum Hamiltonian, rounds the solution, and returns the processed results.

### Important Usage Notes

The current version of this module has some important usage notes and limitations.

#### Encoding Limitations

The [Magic Rounding scheme](https://github.com/qiskit-community/prototype-qrao/blob/main/qrao/magic_rounding.py) is currently only compatible with the (3,1,p) QRAC for encoding classical binary variables onto qubits. If using this rounding scheme, be sure to set `max_vars_per_qubit=3` when instantiating the encoding:
```
encoding = QuantumRandomAccessEncoding(max_vars_per_qubit=3)
```
Refer to the [tutorial on rounding schemes](https://github.com/qiskit-community/prototype-qrao/blob/main/docs/tutorials/02_advanced_usage.ipynb) for example usage.

We plan to make Magic Rounding compatible with additional encoding options in the future.

#### Supported Problem Types

As with `qiskit-optimization`, this module currently only supports input problems that are of type `QuadraticProgram` and that can be converted to a QUBO. Furthermore, the conversion to a QUBO must be made _before_ encoding the problem into a quantum Hamiltonian with `QuantumRandomAccessEncoding` (refer to the tutorial to [see an example of this](https://github.com/qiskit-community/prototype-qrao/blob/main/docs/tutorials/01_getting_started.ipynb))

Check out the documentation for `qiskit-optimization` to see [how to construct a `QuadraticProgram`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-optimization/blob/main/docs/tutorials/01_quadratic_program.ipynb) and [apply converters to it](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-optimization/blob/main/docs/tutorials/02_converters_for_quadratic_programs.ipynb) (including a [wrapper that converts a `QuadraticProgram` to a QUBO](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-optimization/blob/main/qiskit_optimization/converters/quadratic_program_to_qubo.py)).

#### Statevector Simulator Usage

If you would like to use a statevector simulation for Magic Rounding, we advise using the new `AerSimulator` ([source](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/qiskit/providers/aer/backends/aer_simulator.py)) with the `'statevector'` method and _not_ the ([soon-to-be-deprecated](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/73b29ad75a0d206c68aff42d4d63adf3a42b61b5/qiskit/providers/aer/backends/statevector_simulator.py#L178)) `StatevectorSimulator`. The latter suffers from a very poor runtime scaling when used with the Magic Rounding scheme, as it effectively brute-forces all possible solutions.
